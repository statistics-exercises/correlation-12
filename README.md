# Non-linearly correlated random variables

It is now clear that you have grasped the points about linearly correlated random variables that I was trying to make by making you do these exercises.  Given this we will now move on to looking at non-linearly correlated random variables.

If you press the run bottom you should now find that two curves appear as opposed to two lines.  The equations of these two curves are

Your task is to generate 100 random points that lie between these two curves.  As always you should not need to use a conditional (if) statement to complete this task.
